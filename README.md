## Word Database Setup

GridGPT uses a word database built from online crossword sources. Follow these steps to create and maintain the database:

### 1. Scrape Source Data

**Scrape NYT's Mini Crosswords from worddb.com**
```bash
python scripts/scrape_worddb.py --start-date 2023-01-01 --end-date 2023-12-31
```
This creates and updates: `data/01_raw/worddb_com/nyt_mini_clues.json`


### 2. Process Raw Data

**Create the main word database**
```bash
python scripts/create_worddb_database.py
```
This processes the scraped data and creates: `data/02_intermediary/word_database/word_database_full.json`


### 3. Automatic Filtering

Then whenever `WordDatabaseManager()` is initialized in the backend, it automatically creates an up to date filtered databases relevant for the crossword to be generated:
- `data/02_intermediary/word_database/word_database_filtered.json` - Filtered word-clue pairs
- `data/02_intermediary/word_database/word_list_with_frequencies.json` - Word frequency analysis

The filtering process can flexibly:
- limit for minimum and maximum number of characters in a word
- apply a minimum frequency threshold (e.g., words must have been used in a crossword more than 5 times)
- exclude special characters
- remove reference clues (e.g., "See 15-Across")

### Additional sources

*‚ö†Ô∏è The output of the data pipeline below is currently not in use. In the future, it is planned to integrate this data as well as extend the word database with additional sources.*

**Scrape crossword data from crosswordtracker.com**
```bash
python scripts/scrape_crosswords_2.py letters A B C # list which letter to scrape individually
```
This creates: `data/01_raw/crossword_tracker/crossword_words_[A-Z].json`

**Create crossword tracker database**
```bash
python scripts/create_crosswordtracker_word_db.py
```


## Backend Architecture

### Core Components

-- # TODO: rename CrosswordGenerator to Grid generator & then create a single Crossword generator that takes all inputs from the front end and then outputs the final crossword

generator = CrosswordGenerator() # main orchestrator
result = generator.generate_crossword(theme, template_id, cluetype)

**`CrosswordGenerator`**: Grid generator that fills a crossword template grid with a theme entry under the given constraints.
```python
from src.gridgpt.crossword_generator import CrosswordGenerator

generator = CrosswordGenerator()
result = generator.generate_themed_crossword(template=template_dict, theme_entry="FRUIT")
```

**`WordDatabaseManager`**: Fundamental manager for word database operations
```python
from src.gridgpt.word_database_manager import WordDatabaseManager

db_manager = WordDatabaseManager() # with default values
db_manager = WordDatabaseManager( 
    min_frequency=5,
    min_length=3,
    max_length=5,
    exclude_special_chars=True,
    exclude_reference_clues=True
) # with customized values

# Review available database items
db_manager.word_database_filtered
db_manager.word_list_with_frequencies
```

**`ClueGenerator`**: AI-powered clue creation
```python
from src.gridgpt.clue_manager import ClueGenerator

clue_gen = ClueGenerator()
clue = clue_gen.generate_clue(word="PYTHON", theme="programming")
```

**`ClueRetriever`**: Retrieval of previously published clues
```python
from src.gridgpt.clue_manager import ClueRetriever

clue_retriever = ClueRetriever()

# Identify all listed clues for a word in the database
available_clues = clue_retriever.get_available_clues(word="PYTHON")

# Randomly select a single clue from the database
available_clues = clue_retriever.retrieve_clue(word="PYTHON")
```

**`TemplateManager`**: Grid template management
```python
from src.gridgpt.template_manager import select_template

template = select_template(template_id="5x5_diagonal_cut")
```

### API Endpoints

- `GET /api/templates` - List available grid templates
- `POST /api/generate-crossword` - Generate a complete crossword puzzle
- `POST /api/check-solution` - Check solution against correct answers
- `GET /api/test` - Verify endpoint is working
- `GET /health` - API health check

## Frontend Architecture

### Key Components

**`CrosswordGenerator`**: Main interface component with:
- Template selection with visual preview icons
- Clue type selection (generated vs. retrieved, mandatory)
- Theme input (optional)
- Output crossword grid with interactive fill and solution checks
- Generated/retrieved clue panel

‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ tests/                 # Test suites
```

### Adding New Templates

1. **Define the template** in `data/03_templates/grid_templates.json`
2. **Add SVG pattern** to `GridPreview` component
3. **Test generation** with the new template


## Configuration

Configuration files are located in `conf/base/`:

Key configuration files:
- `parameters.yml`: Generation parameters
- `prompts.yml`: AI prompt templates
- `catalog.yml`: List of used data files
- `credentials.yml`: API keys and secrets # TODO: move keys here from .env

## Next steps:

Some of my ideas for future updates and enhancements are:

- Include a difficulty parameter that influences clue generation
- Expand word database sources to include a greater number of words
- Allow inclusion of words that are not listed in the word database (i.e., new entries; potentially with LLM verification)
- Expand templates to different sizes than the plain 5x5 Mini set-up, or even allow flexible user creation of a grid template
- Integrate other LLM providers

## About

Hi fellow crossword enthusiasts! I'm Marie, a data scientist based in Berlin with a huge passion for all sorts of games and riddles ‚Äì especially crosswords.

There's something magical about that perfect "aha!" moment when a tricky clue finally clicks ‚Äì it's similar to when you finally fix that frustrating bug that's been haunting your code for hours, or when your data pipeline runs flawlessly from start to finish.

So naturally, I thought: why not combine my love for puzzles with my passion for all things data and engineering?

That's how GridGPT was born!

### How It Works

GridGPT builds crosswords through a pipeline that blends real data, embeddings, optimization, and LLMs:

üìö **Crossword database:** A curated set of published words and clues ensures authenticity and quality.

üéØ **Theme matching:** Embeddings rank database words by semantic similarity to your theme, picking atheme entry that initializes the grid.

ü§ñ **Backfill optimization:** A custom algorithm fills the grid via constraint satisfaction, keeping every intersection valid and solvable.

‚úçÔ∏è **Clue generation:** Choose between:

- **Retrieved:** Randomly selected, authentic clues pulled from the database
- **Generated:** AI-crafted clues from OpenAI, prompted for theme-alignment, fairness and wit

### Background

I built GridGPT to mix data science optimization with LLM creativity ‚Äì essentially creating a completely new, unique puzzle at the click of a button.

This is a hobby project born from curiosity: what happens when you blend algorithmic thinking with AI creativity?

Now, let me be clear ‚Äì this in no way substitutes the brilliant human creativity and clever wordplay that goes into creating those delightful crosswords that professional constructors make. Human-made crosswords have soul, wit, and those perfect "gotcha!" moments that only come from genuine craftsmanship.

GridGPT is more like a fun experiment in computational creativity ‚Äì for those moments when you want a quick puzzle fix, you're curious about a specific theme, or just seeing what an AI thinks makes a good crossword clue.

Whether you‚Äôre new to crosswords or a seasoned solver, enjoy exploring!

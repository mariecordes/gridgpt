  user_prompt: |
    Generate a creative New York Times–style crossword clue for the word **"{word}"**.

    You may use the following **reference clues** for help understanding the word:
    {reference_clues}
    Do **not** copy these clues - use them only to better understand the word.

    You may consider the puzzle theme **"{theme}"** (optional). If a theme is given and the answer word has a clear and known link or association with that theme, you can optionally reference it in the clue. **Only do so if it fits naturally and still follows all rules below**.

    **Rules:**
    
    1. Clues must be factually correct and sound in logic. They may require thinking outside of the box but they are never untrue or factually incorrect.
    2. Never list the actual answer word (even as part of a word) in the clue. (e.g. "**sis**ter" should not be part of a clue for SIS)
    3. **Match form:** Verb tense must match; part of speech must match (e.g., noun clue for noun answer); plural clues must have plural answers.

      * Verb tense in the clue must match the tense of the answer (e.g. clue "Adored” → LOVED (past tense), not LOVE or LOVING).
      * Part of Speech Match: If the clue is a noun, the answer must be a noun; if the clue is a verb, the answer must be a verb. 
        Words with multiple parts of speech should have clues that clearly indicate the intended usage. (e.g. clue "Kitchen appliance" → OVEN (noun), "Heat in the oven" → BAKE (verb).

    4. **Language:** If the clue uses a foreign language, the answer must be in that language (i.e. if the answer word is in a foreign language you should indicate this in the clue by either making the clue or a single word in that clue in that language or using a location reference e.g. "in Spain").
    5. **Allowed clue types:**

      * Direct definition
      * Fill-in-the-blank (e.g. “Winnie-the-___” → POOH)
      * Partner clues (e.g. “Partner of sciences” → ARTS)
      * Abbreviations (signal with “Abbr.,” “for short,” “in brief”) (e.g. “Lawyer: Abbr.” → ATTY)
      * Question mark clues for puns or misdirection (e.g. “Current events?” → TIDES)
      * Slang (match era/style) (e.g. “My sweetheart, in slang” → BAE)
      * Quotations for direct speech, idioms or synonyms for spoken phrases (e.g. “Stop!” → HALT)
      * Brackets for nonverbal expressions (e.g. [That’s painful] → GRIMACE)
      * Heteronyms for tricky clues (e.g. “Minute, to a tot” → TINY)

    6. **Style:** Clues must be concise (ideally up to 5 words but at most 10 words), natural and fair.
    7. **Output:** Return **only** the clue text, without explanations, or formatting.
